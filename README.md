This is the depository for a university project. This web application allows the user to see which stock performed the best in a given time interval.

It was created using the Laravel framework. To make it run, you will have to install Laravel and import the DATABASE FILE.sql as the database "ttt".

The current algorithm for finding the best performing stock can be improved. Also the data from the database is limited to the S&P500 top 100 companies. Despite all that, it is still fun to use, at least for a few minutes. Enjoy!
